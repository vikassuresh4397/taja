## Description

 Create an inventory managemnet system where a user can add products on one page, maintain the data in local storage and and see list of products on a different page. The user should also be able to delete any product from the list
 
  - Index.html
    - Create a form which will accept name, brand, price, and image link from the user with ids for input tags being- ```product_name``` , ```product_brand``` , ```product_price``` and ```product_image``` respectively. Also, the input tags values should become null as soon as form is submitted.
    
    - Complete the ```getFormData``` function to get the data and then invoke ```addData``` function with name, brand, price, and imgLink as arguments. (Note: make sure you are preventing the default behaviour of the form to refresh the page- you can refer to[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event))
    
    - ```addData``` function should take the form data and store the data (you should retrieve the older data, (if any) and add new products to the array) in local storage as array of items with key ```data```
    
    - follow the below schema to store the data in local storage
       ```
       {
        name
        brand
        price
        image
       }
       ```
     
    - Complete the ```redirect``` function to redirect the user to inventory.html page, (this function should be invoked when show all products button is clicked)

 - Inventory.html
   - This page should show all the products present in grid format using grid templates  (3 columns) from the local storage. (complete the ```append``` function to achieve this)
   
   - The products need to be appended to div with id = #products_data (retrieve information from localStorage and then append the data)
   
   - The user should be able to remove products. The DOM and localstorage should be updated in real-time after deleting. (send index of the product added to identify which product needs to be deleted)
   
   - Complete the ```redirect``` function to redirect the user to inventory.html page, (this function should be invoked when Add more product button is clicked)
